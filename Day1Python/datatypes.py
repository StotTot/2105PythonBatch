# Python has quite a few data types. It considers it's collections (think list or array or dicitonary) as a datatype

# numeric types
i = 100 # of type int (integer type)
ii: int = 100

f = 100.7 # of type float (decimal values)
ff: float = 1986.5

# text types
s = "Hello Everyone" # of type str (strings and text) there is NO character type
ss: str = "Hello Everyone"

# Boolean type
t = True # boolean values are True or False
f = False
tt: bool = True

# NoneType
# Python does not have null instead it has None 
# very similar to null and functionally identical in most ways
n = None

# to find the type of something there is an in built type function
print(type(i))
