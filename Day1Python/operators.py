# Python operators work like most programming languages

# arithmetic operators
a = 10 + 10 # add 
b = 100 - 40 # subtract
c = 5 * 4  # multiply
d = 10/2 # divide
e = 4**3 # 4 to the power of 3
f = 10//3 # floor division operator output is 20  the division rounded down
g = 10%3 # modulous gets the remainder

# comparison operators

x = 100
y = 100


x == y # is equal to (different than) the "value" is the same
x != y # not equal to
x > y # greater than
y < x # less than
x >= y # greater than or equal to
x <= y # less than or equal to

# logical operators
x == y and y < 1000 or y ==9


# is the letter g not  in a string
print("g" not in "lskdfldsknflnk")

# python has a really weird ternary that I am not a huge fan of
x = "Hello" if 4<5 else "World"
