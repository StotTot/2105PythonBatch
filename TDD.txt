TDD Done the right way

1. design an interface with many functions
	Craft method signtures
		name of the method, the types it takes in, the order the parameters, what it returns

2. Write tests that would prove those functions work as intended
	a. They serve as a way to test functionality
	b. Making you use the functions to see if they are intuitive to use as designed
	c. Are there any edge cases or weird inputs you might not have considered
		edge cases are inputs that are uncommon or might be troublesome
		a good example is 0.

3. Write the implementation
	fill out the funcitons

4. Keep refining your code until you pass all the test cases

I GUARANTEE YOU THIS WILL APPROACH WILL SAVE YOU TIME!!!!!!!!!
I WILL NOT HELP YOU DEBUG YOUR PROJECTS UNLESS YOU HAVE TESTS!!!!!
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IS NOT FIXING BUGS. IT IS FINDING WHERE THEY COME FROM!!!!
